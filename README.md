# Machine Learning Projects and Learning Documents

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains learning materials and projects focused on **Classification, Regression, and Clustering**. I have explored various datasets, performed in-depth data analysis, and developed the best prediction models using different machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ“– Learning Documents
- **Classification**: Concepts, algorithms, and techniques for supervised learning tasks.
- **Regression**: Understanding linear and nonlinear regression models.
- **Clustering**: Unsupervised learning techniques for grouping similar data points.

### ðŸ“Š Projects
Each project involves:
- Dataset exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation and comparison

#### ðŸš€ Key Projects:
1. **Predicting house prices using regression models.**
2. **Employee Attrition predictions** 
3. **[Telecommunication customer churn predictions]**
